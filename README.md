This script reproduces the main figures and analyses for the publication "Photosystem II heat tolerances characterize thermal generalists and the upper limit of carbon assimilation." The analyses are straightforward and basically consistent of calculating phylogenetically-corrected Pearson's correlation coefficients to test hypotheses regarding the expected relationships between leaf carbon assimilation traits and photosynthetic heat tolerances. 


This file contains the data used in the main text and the clade ages from Gastauer & Meira-Neto 2017 (https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0102-33062017000200191&script=sci_abstract). The code used to estimate the carbon assimilation parameters can be found here (https://github.com/tmoreperez/AT_Curve_function) and the code used to estimate photosynthetic heat tolerances can be found here (https://github.com/tmoreperez/Heat_tolerance_function).
